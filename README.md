# [:bulb:] Why?

<p align="justify">
This project was initially created during the TQI FullStack Development Bootcamp (Digital Innovation One) as a Super Mario Bros game. However, I decided to revamp it with a Yu-Gi-Oh! concept to give it a cooler edge. Given that Yu-Gi-Oh! is a card game, I felt it was a perfect fit for this project.
