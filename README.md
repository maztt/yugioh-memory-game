# yugioh-memory-game
Feel the nostalgia of playing the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game, but this time as a memory matching though.

This project was originally developed at TQI FullStack Development Bootcamp (Digital Innovation One) as a Super Mario Bros game, but I reproduced it in a Yu-Gi-Oh! concept because I think it sounds cooler. Well, Yu-Gi-Oh! was indeed a card game after all.
